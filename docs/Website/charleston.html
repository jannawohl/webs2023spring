    <h1>Charleston, South Carolina </h1>
    <p> I have recently traveled to Charleston, South Carolina for a weekend with friends and loved exploring this cute, Southern town. We explored the College of Charleston, the Charleston City Market, the pretty Rainbow Row, and lots more. Overall, it is a trip I would definitely recommend to others if they're looking for a chill but fun weekend trip!  </p>
