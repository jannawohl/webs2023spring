    <h1>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania </h1>
    <p> Attending the University of Pittsburgh for college has been one of the greatest decisions I have made. I have loved exploring the different areas of the city and spending my college years in such a unique place. I will truly miss going to Pitt football games, getting a gorgeous view of the Cathedral of Learning everyday, and trying new restaurants/tourist attractions with my friends. </p>
